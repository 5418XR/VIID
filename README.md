**Empowering the visually impaired with AI-powered image descriptions transformed into audible experiences.**

## Overview

VIID leverages the power of cutting-edge AI models, like miniGPT4 and GPT4, combined with image recognition and text-to-speech technologies, to offer the visually impaired a unique opportunity to "hear" the visual world around them.


## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Accurate image recognition to capture essential details.
- **AI-Powered Descriptions**: Enhanced detail recognition using miniGPT4 and enriched textual descriptions using GPT4.
- **Blind-Friendly Textual Adaptation**: Textual content refinement tailored for the visually impaired audience.
- **Text-to-Speech Transformation**: Convert descriptions into clear, comprehensible, and natural audio using gtts.
